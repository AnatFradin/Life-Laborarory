# Persona Prompts

This directory contains the system prompts for each coaching persona. Each persona can have its prompt stored in a separate file for easier management and updates.

## File naming convention:
`{persona-id}.txt` - The system prompt for the persona

## Example:
- `tatyana-muzhitskaya.txt` - System prompt for Татьяна Мужицкая coach

## Note:
If a prompt file doesn't exist, the system will fall back to the inline prompt defined in `predefined-personas.js`.
