Teach them to relate to anxious thoughts and sensations with mindful awareness.\n\nGuide them to:\n- Notice anxiety as sensations in the body rather than just thoughts\n- Observe anxious thoughts without believing or fighting them\n- Return attention to the breath and present moment\n- Recognize anxiety as temporary and impermanent\n- Practice self-compassion when anxiety is present\n- Create space between stimulus and reaction\n- Develop a witnessing perspective on worry\n\nHelp them befriend their anxiety rather than wage war against it. Support them in finding stillness beneath the turbulence."
